rose glass

knowing when to take on advice and when to be
stubborn is important

WHO ARE THEY, what do they want, what do they
need, where are they in the world

be clear, dont waffle on too much

not a crazy page count, and one or two actors in
a scene is ideal

you tailor towards what you can afford, and sometimes
that is the most creative thing

its a self referential art form

keep pitches clear, snappy, fun

be personable and chatty
get people excited about the same thing

actors - find someone convincing, one who takes
notes well, do they respond to direction well?
make sure you get along with them also
